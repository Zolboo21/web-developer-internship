### Development of Website for Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics of Mongolian Academy Science
This project involves the development of a new website for the Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. The website will be built using the latest technology, including Node.js for the backend, MongoDB for database management, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. To support the website's deployment and management, the project will utilize Google Cloud Platform (GCP), PM2 for process management, and Bootstrap for a responsive design. The goal is to create a modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing website that accurately reflects the institute's image and mission. Through this internship, I will be utilizing my skills in website development to support the work of the institute and help improve its online presence.
